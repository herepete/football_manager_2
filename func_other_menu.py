    So you have played a season and here is your chance to wheel and deal and improve your team.
    The broad steps are:
    1) pre draft - you are given 3 draft picks based on your previous seasons perforamnce , you can Move up and down draft, sell players for extra draft picks , renew/release players
    2) draft - use your draft picks to aquire new players 
    3) post draft - Sign free agents, sign undrafted players to improve the development squad, make final descsions on renew/relasing players.
    4) all finished of to the next season for you

    a few notes:
    you can only sell players for draft picks if they have 1 year or more left on their contact
    you can exceed the budget during the draft but not when siging free agents or renewing contracts

    the Development squad constsits of 2 GK, 2 Def, 2 Mid, 2 Ata (players can only be under 24 years old in the dev squad)
    the Dev Squad is designed as a place to store good young players not good enough to get into the main squad at the moment
    Dev squad players are all on 1 year contract for 1Â£
    Dev squad players have no impact on the wage bill (unless they are promoted)
    You cannot move a player back to the Dev squad after they have been promoted

    When you release/sell a player you will need to promote a member of your Dev squad.
    After the draft has finished you can sign new undrafted players to replace members of your dev squad

    If you don't have the time/energy/intrest to play with new dev players, after the draft has finished , you can auto release all out of contract players and replace them with random players    
    When the dev players get to old they will be released.

free agents func_other_create_players.py

Notes
====

you may have to pay a higher salary if you are replacing a player with 1 year or more left on the contract or a wage of above 1
1 year contract renewal has a preium of +1 (unless wage is 5 and then its +2)
2 year contract as above
3 year contract renewal -1

As above the top Tier of Free agents have a premium

Over age of 32 free agents you can initally only sign on a 1 year

The idea is to get you to draft young players and make them the nucules of your squad
A few Free agents spinglinged here and there can improve a team
As per the Nfl when a draft prospect from the 1st round reaches the end of the a contract there can be a heafty jump in wages
