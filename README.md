The latest and greatest


Welcome to Football Manager Draft
===============
This game is a mashup of football and NFL
The aim of the game is to win the Superbowl
And to give you 30ish mins of fun.

Each game will by default last 20 seasons (a lot of these seeing can be changed through editing func_other_game_settings.py)
You will be given a randomised poor squad at the begening of the game.

A squad constist of 3 Goalkeeper,8 Defenders,7 Midfielders & 6 Atackers
Your team score is based on the skill ratings of your top 11 players in a 4-4-2 formation.

Typically a top team score is 100.

If you draw a game the game will go to overtime to force a result.

You will play 16 games in a season and if you win enough games you will enter the playoffs (depending on the number of wins you will enter at a different point)
The playoff has 4 rounds, with the 4th being the Superbowl.

After the season has finished your players will lose/gain skill based on age/character/experience of other players in the squad/luck/ability.

Then you will have a chance to improve your team by drafting young players through the draft or you can swap your picks for established players.
There are 3 rounds to the draft , with the 1st Round having players with better skills.
You can swap your players for extra draft picks.
You can move up and down the draft (i.e if you have swapped your players for extra picks you can create another first or second pick, so if you have 2 great GK you could trade one for another pick to help strethen another position)

And then you start a new season.

At the top of the screen you will see a header giving you an overview of where you are in the game.
Throughout the game there is a help menu to find out more detailed info on how stuff works.


Good luck & enjoy :)
